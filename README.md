# Burnout 3: Takedown - Static Recompilation for Windows 11

> **The first known static recompilation of an original Xbox game into a native PC executable.**

> **This fork:** independent reverse-engineering research on this exact retail binary lives in [`research/`](research/) and [`docs/decomp-atlas/`](docs/decomp-atlas/function-atlas.html) (a Ghidra function atlas, cross-referenced against other Burnout 3 recompilation/reimplementation efforts — see [research/ROADMAP.md](research/ROADMAP.md) for the history of how it got here). No upstream code is modified by this addition. Note: this repository has no stated license, so treat contributions here accordingly (fork/PR, don't assume redistribution rights).

This project takes the original Xbox binary of **Burnout 3: Takedown** (2004, Criterion Games / EA) — all 2.73 MB of raw x86 machine code — and translates every single function into native C code that compiles and runs on modern Windows. No emulation. No interpreter. Just 22,097 recompiled functions executing as a native x86-64 binary.

## Why This Is Interesting

Static recompilation has seen incredible progress on other platforms — [N64: Recompiled](https://github.com/N64Recomp/N64Recomp) proved MIPS→C was viable, and [XenonRecomp](https://github.com/hedge-dev/XenonRecomp) brought the technique to Xbox 360's PowerPC architecture with projects like Sonic Unleashed getting full native PC ports. But the **original Xbox** has been overlooked. Its emulation scene relies on dynamic recompilation (Cxbx-Reloaded, xemu), and there's a [Halo CE decompilation research project](https://github.com/halo-re/halo), but nobody has attempted a full static recompilation of a retail OG Xbox game — until now.

What makes OG Xbox uniquely interesting for static recomp: it's x86, so the source and target architectures are closely related (x86 → x86-64). But it also means dealing with all of x86's quirks: variable-length instructions, complex addressing modes, flags register, FPU stack, and segment prefixes. Plus the Xbox SDK has 11 statically-linked libraries baked into every game binary that you have to identify and handle.

This project proves it can be done:
- **22,097 functions** lifted from machine code to C, compiling to a native `.exe`
- **The game boots, loads its assets, and enters gameplay** — the original state machine, physics, and game logic all running through recompiled code
- **Real game assets rendered** — actual track geometry with textures loaded from the original game files
- **Every Xbox kernel call replaced** — 147 kernel imports mapped to Win32 equivalents
- **64 MB of Xbox memory faithfully reproduced** using `CreateFileMapping` with mirror views

The technical challenges are fascinating: translating x86 to x86-64 with a global register model, handling indirect calls through a 22K-entry dispatch table, reproducing Xbox memory layout at the right virtual addresses, and implementing a D3D8-to-D3D11 translation layer for the GPU.

## Current Status

**Phase 5: Integration** — The game boots, loads all resources, transitions through state 4 (crash mode) → state 5 (menus/frontend), and renders the main menu with all UI elements. The D3D8LTCG rendering pipeline has been un-stubbed with a live NV2A push buffer translation pipeline proven end-to-end.

### What's Working
- **Full main menu rendering** — all 5 menu options (World Tour, Single Event, Multiplayer, Xbox Live, Driver Details) rendered via NV2A push buffer → D3D11 translation
  - Burnout 3 logo, "Select Option" header, button prompts, scrolling chyron ticker
  - 32 draw calls/frame, 3078 vertices, 11 texture bindings from Global.txd + captured font atlas
  - Time-based smooth chyron scroll animation at 50px/sec
  - Per-draw texture mapping via NV2A VRAM offset → Global.txd name lookup
- **Live NV2A push buffer pipeline** — the original D3D8LTCG rendering function (sub_0034D530, 79KB / 20K lines of generated C) has been un-stubbed and runs cleanly, writing NV2A viewport/transform commands to a 4MB push buffer each frame. Device cursor sync, per-frame buffer reset, and live parser all operational. D3D8 device context populated with surface descriptors, viewport, and push buffer pointers.
- **Boot video sequence** — Criterion logo, EA logo, and title intro videos play from pre-converted XMV→MP4 files via Media Foundation
- Full game boot sequence through the original RenderWare engine init
- **Game state machine**: loading → init → state 4 (crash) → state 5 (menus/frontend) — running continuously at ~32 FPS
- **RW→D3D11 rendering bridge** — the original RenderWare display driver pipeline (sub_001DDAF0 → sub_00351090) routes through our D3D8→D3D11 layer
- **Im2d 2D rendering pipeline** — RwIm2DRenderPrimitive (sub_001DE900) overridden to route pre-transformed 2D vertices through D3D8→D3D11
- **Game audio events** — AWD sounds triggered on state transitions (Zoom on state 7→4, MenuIn on state 4→5, GlobeHigh startup chime)
- **37 playable tracks** loaded from game files with fly camera and drive mode
- **160 DXT textures per track** loaded from `static.dat` and mapped to geometry
- **67 vehicle models** across 7 classes (Compact, Coupe, Heavy, etc.)
- **AWD audio playback** — Fe.awd (50 sounds) and Generic.awd loaded, software mixer with 64 voices
- **MCPX APU audio emulation** — xemu's Voice Processor extracted and running standalone (256 voices, ADPCM/PCM, envelopes, HRTF, filters)
- **NV2A GPU translation** — push buffer method handler translates NV2A Kelvin methods (BEGIN_END, INLINE_ARRAY, texture state, viewport, blend/depth/cull) to D3D8→D3D11 calls
- **Xbox texture unswizzle** — Morton/Z-order decode for non-DXT textures including non-square dimensions (A1R5G5B5, R5G6B5, A8R8G8B8, etc.)
- **VEH fault handling** — divide-by-zero, access violations, and 32-bit overflow all handled gracefully
- **Native pointer resolution** — RW allocator stores native heap pointers in Xbox memory; transparent native↔Xbox VA conversion
- File loading pipeline reads game resources into Xbox memory space
- Keyboard + gamepad input (XInput)
- D3D11 rendering through a D3D8 compatibility layer

### What's Left
- [ ] Regenerate sub_00351090 (RW scene traversal) — disassembler found 0 functions in D3D section, needs function boundary detection for XDK library code
- [ ] Sub-menu navigation (New Profile, Save/Load, World Tour country/map selection)
- [ ] NV2A register combiner emulation (currently hardcoded MODULATE blend mode)
- [ ] Connect RW scene traversal to live push buffer pipeline (render list population)
- [ ] Connect game's DirectSound init (sub_00135040) to APU voice processor
- [ ] Vehicle textures (`.btv` paint variant format)
- [ ] Full collision / physics world initialization
- [ ] Performance optimization

## How It Works

### The Recompilation Pipeline

```
default.xbe (Xbox executable)
    ↓
XBE Parser → extracts 17 sections, 147 kernel imports
    ↓
Disassembler → finds 20,816 functions, 920K instructions
    ↓
x86→C Lifter → generates 4.43 million lines of C code
    ↓
MSVC Compiler → native x86-64 .exe
    ↓
Runtime: Xbox kernel shim + D3D8→D3D11 + memory layout → Game runs!
```

### Register Model

The Xbox uses x86 (32-bit Pentium III). We translate to x86-64 C code with a simulated register model:

```c
// Global registers (shared across all 22,097 functions)
uint32_t g_eax, g_ecx, g_edx, g_esp;  // volatile
uint32_t g_ebx, g_esi, g_edi;          // callee-saved

// Each recompiled function looks like:
void sub_00012345(void) {
    uint32_t ebp;           // local frame pointer
    PUSH32(g_ebp);          // push to simulated stack
    ebp = g_esp;
    g_eax = MEM32(ebp + 8); // read argument from Xbox stack
    // ... translated instructions ...
    POP32(g_ebp);
    RECOMP_RET();
}
```

### Memory Architecture

The Xbox has 64 MB of unified RAM starting at address 0. We reproduce this layout exactly:

- **CreateFileMapping** allocates a 64 MB region as a shared memory object
- **28 MapViewOfFileEx** calls create mirror views at specific addresses
- Xbox code reads/writes memory at the same addresses it would on real hardware
- Special regions: NV2A GPU registers at 0xFD000000+, kernel at 0x80010000+

### D3D8 → D3D11 Translation

The Xbox uses a modified Direct3D 8 API. We implement a full D3D8 COM interface that translates to D3D11:

- Vertex/index buffer creation, Lock/Unlock with staging buffers
- Fixed-function pipeline emulated via HLSL shaders (world/view/proj transforms, lighting, texture stages)
- Render state translation (200+ D3D8 states mapped to D3D11 equivalents)
- DXT1/DXT3/DXT5 compressed textures loaded directly (D3D11 supports these natively)

### Indirect Call Dispatch

The biggest challenge: the game makes thousands of indirect calls (virtual methods, function pointers) that we can't resolve at compile time. Our RECOMP_ICALL macro handles this with a 3-tier lookup:

1. **Manual overrides** — 32 hand-written function replacements
2. **Auto-generated dispatch table** — 22,097 entries mapping Xbox addresses to C functions
3. **Kernel bridge** — Xbox kernel thunks at 0xFE000000+ routed to Win32 implementations
